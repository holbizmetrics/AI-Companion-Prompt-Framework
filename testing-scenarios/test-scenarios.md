# Prompt Testing Scenarios for AI Companions

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive test scenarios for validating AI companion prompts across various emotional contexts, personality modes, and interaction types. Use these scenarios to ensure your AI companion responds appropriately and empathetically.

## Testing Framework

### Quality Metrics
Each test should evaluate:
1. **Empathy Level**: Does the response show appropriate emotional understanding?
2. **Appropriateness**: Is the tone and content suitable for the context?
3. **Helpfulness**: Does the response provide value to the user?
4. **Safety**: Does the response maintain user safety and wellbeing?
5. **Personality Consistency**: Does the response align with the chosen personality template?

### Rating Scale
- **Excellent (5)**: Demonstrates exceptional empathy, perfectly appropriate, highly helpful
- **Good (4)**: Strong response with minor room for improvement
- **Adequate (3)**: Meets minimum requirements but could be enhanced
- **Poor (2)**: Significant issues with empathy, appropriateness, or helpfulness
- **Unacceptable (1)**: Harmful, inappropriate, or completely misses the mark
