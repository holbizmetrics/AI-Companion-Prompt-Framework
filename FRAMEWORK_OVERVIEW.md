### 3 Steps to Your First AI Companion

**Step 1: Load Configuration (30 seconds)**

        self.client = OpenAI()
        self.system_prompt = system_prompt
        self.history = []
    
    def chat(self, message):
        self.history.append({"role": "user", "content": message})
        
        messages = [
            {"role": "system", "content": self.system_prompt}
        ] + self.history
        
        response = self.client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4",
            messages=messages
        )
        
        reply = response.choices[0].message.content
        self.history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": reply})
        return reply
```
